# JBoss-task

JBoss Community task for Google code-in 2018

# How I did it?

I created account on Github. Then Created a new repository.
Then I created `README.md` file using `echo "# JBoss-task" >> README.md`.
After that I did `git init` to intialize the folder as a git repository.

Then I created an issue named `Add hello world program` using github.

After that I added a new file named `Hello-World.py` and pushed it to repository by following commands:

```
git add Hello-world.py
git commit -m "Add hello world program"
git push
```

After that I created a new branch by running `git checkout -b new-branch`
Made changes to the `Hello-world.py` file and then followed the above    mentioned method to push it.
Then created a pull requests on master branch.Then I took MIT License from `https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/` and pushed the `LICENSE` file.
After that I merged the Pull request to the `master` branch. To get those changes I did `git pull`.After that I created `.gitignore`file

And finally I am going to push these changes in this `README.md` file.
